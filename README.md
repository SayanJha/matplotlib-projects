# 📊 Matplotlib Projects

Welcome to my dedicated repository for data visualization projects built using Python's **Matplotlib** library!  
This repo is structured to help me learn, practice, and showcase various types of plots — neatly organized into folders for easy navigation.

## 📚 About the Repository

This project serves as a collection of Python scripts focusing on creating visualizations using Matplotlib.  
Each type of plot has its own dedicated folder containing example scripts, organized and documented for learning and future reference.
