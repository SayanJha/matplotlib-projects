# 📊 Matplotlib Projects

Welcome to my dedicated repository for data visualization projects built using Python's **Matplotlib** library!  
This repo is structured to help me learn, practice, and showcase various types of plots — neatly organized into folders for easy navigation.

## 📚 About the Repository

This project serves as a collection of Python scripts focusing on creating visualizations using Matplotlib.  
Each type of plot has its own dedicated folder containing example scripts, organized and documented for learning and future reference.

## 📈 What's Inside

- **Line Plots**  
  📌 Basic line plots, multiple line plots, line styles, markers, and grids.

- **Scatter Plots**  
  📌 Scatter plots with varying color, size, and labels.

- **Bar Charts**  
  📌 Vertical, horizontal, grouped, and customized bar charts.

- **Pie Charts**  
  📌 Pie charts with percentage labels, explode effects, and custom colors.

- **Histograms**  
  📌 Frequency distribution of numerical data with adjustable bins.

- **Subplots**  
  📌 Multiple plots displayed in a grid layout in one figure.

- **Other Visualizations**  
  📌 Heatmaps, polar plots, area charts, etc.

- **Images**  
  📌 Saved screenshots/previews of the generated plots.

- **Data**  
  📌 Sample datasets used in plots (if any).
